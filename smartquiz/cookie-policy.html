  <h1>Cookie Policy</h1>
  <p>SmartQuiz does not use cookies or similar tracking technologies through its app or website. However, it does use
    local storage mechanisms such as Shared Preferences and Firebase services for authentication and database purposes.

  <h2>Local Storage</h2>
  <p>We use local storage only to retain user preferences and gameplay data for a better user experience. No personal
    information is stored via cookies.</p>

  <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>While SmartQuiz does not directly use cookies, Firebase (our backend service provider) may store minimal user
    session information as part of its core functionality. Please refer to Firebaseâ€™s privacy practices for more
    details.</p>
